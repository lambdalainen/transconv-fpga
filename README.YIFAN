Test transposed convolution with sparse GEMM

We start with

A: 1 2 3
   3 2 1
   1 2 3

K: 1 2
   3 4

Flatten both, we have 9x1 * 1x4 = 9x4 matrix. Conceptually we use col2im to cherry pick elements
to form the 4x4 results of the transposed convolution. In practice, this step is optimized away
to avoid the need for the extra memory to store the 9x4 matrix.
